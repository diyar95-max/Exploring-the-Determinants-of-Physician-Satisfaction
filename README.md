# Exploring-the-Determinants-of-Physician-Satisfaction
A study on the determinants of physician satisfaction across medical specialties
# Title: "Determinants of Physician Satisfaction"
# Abstract: 
The current research investigates the predictors of physician satisfaction across different specialties, such as income per annum, workload manageability, control over lifestyle, and risk of infection. Multiple regression analysis was employed to explain 81% of the variance in satisfaction, with the most predictive being manageability of workload.
# Objectives: 
- To determine major determinants of physician satisfaction.
- To examine variation in satisfaction by medical specialty.
- For developing a prediction model for doctor satisfaction.
# Key Findings: 
- Workload manageability has the greatest correlation with satisfaction (r = 0.8).
- Salary and lifestyle control also play a large role.
- Infection risk and work hours negatively affect satisfaction.

# Report: Determinants of Physician Satisfaction
## Introduction
The determinants of physician satisfaction, including salary, workload, lifestyle control, and risk of infection, are the focus of this study.
## Methodology
Multiple regression analysis was employed to contrast these factors with overall satisfaction.
## Results
- Workload manageability was the strongest predictor (r = 0.8).
- Salary and lifestyle control were also significant.
- Risk of infection and work hours had adverse effects on satisfaction.
## Discussion
The results indicate that enhancing workload manageability and providing competitive compensation can increase physician satisfaction.
## Conclusion
This research emphasizes the need to address both financial and non-financial aspects to enhance physician well-being.
